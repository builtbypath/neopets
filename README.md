## ⚠️ A Quick Safety Note

Download userscripts at your own risk. Always run any userscript through a virus checker before installing — even if it looks simple.

Userscripts can easily be modified for malicious purposes. If someone customizes or reshares this script elsewhere, run that version through a checker too before trusting it.

Stay safe out there!
